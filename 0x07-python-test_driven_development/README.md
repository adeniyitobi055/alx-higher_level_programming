## 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

- This project is focused on Software Testing.

### Definition of Software Testing
- Software Testing is a process of evaluating a system and its components with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system to identify any gaps, error, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

#### Unit Testing
- This type of testing is performed by developers before the setup is handed over to the testing team to formally execute the test cases. Unit testing is performed by the respective developers on the individual unit of source code assigned areas. 
- Test cases involves a set of steps, conditions, and inputs that can be used while performing testing tasks.


### Scripts
- The scripts above represent different codes and their test files with extension .txt are contained in the test directory to test every possible case of the codes.
