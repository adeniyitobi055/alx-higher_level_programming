## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary


### Below is described what each script/file is doing.

0. It computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. It replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2. Adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
3. Returns a set of common elements present in two sets.
4. Returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. Returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. Prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
7. Replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
8. Deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
10. Returns the key with the biggest integer value.
11. Returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
12. Converts Roman numerals to numbers.
13. Returns the weighted average of all integers in a tuple (script 100).
14. Computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map (script 101).
15. Deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary (script 102).


### Definitions

- A dictionary is an unordered and mutable Python container that stores mappings of unique keys to values.

- keys() method in Python is used to retrieve all of the keys from the dictionary. The keys must be of an immutable type (string, number, or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique. Each key is separated from its value by a colon(:). 
A key-value pair consists of two related data elements: A key, which is a constant that defines the data set (e.g., gender, color, price), and a value, which is a variable that belongs to the set (e.g., male/female, green, 100)
