## 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

One core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) language is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierachy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.

### Benefits of inheritance are:
- It reresents a real-world relationship well.
- It provides the reusability of a code. We don't have to write the same code agin and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
- Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
- Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

This project will show some cases of how to use inheritance and its advantages will correspond to the above points.

### Tests(software testing)
This directory contains files used for test cases to test the function making sure no criteria is left out.

### Test_main(main functions)
This directory contains files that are used to test the functions to verify if they're operating as expected.
