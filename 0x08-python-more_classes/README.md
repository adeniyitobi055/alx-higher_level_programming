## 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

- This project is focused on Rectangle. Every task from 0 to the last is built on the previous. It's touches areas like:
	- Area and perimeter
	- String representation (__str__): using a string to represent the shape of the rectangle.
	- Eval(): The eval() function is one of the Python built-in functions. The word ‘eval’ can be thought of as a short for			 m for ‘evaluation’, which is the process of finding the output.
	- __del__: detecting when an instance has been deleted.
	- Compares rectangles to find out which is bigger.
	- Takes note of instances when added and dedleted.
